# ImageClassification_JenaFlowersDataset

Classifying 30 different classes of flowers present in Jena Flowers Dataset using Convolutional Neural Network model.
Imported class labels and images from drive. Preprocessed the data and partitioned into Training data and Validation data. Trained a model using CNN for classification of 30 different classes. Used data augmentation to the training images and also used Transfer Learning, built a predictive model which will predict class of the flower.

Got the dataset from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0HNECY
